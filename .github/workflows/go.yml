# This workflow shows how to build and release a CGo-encumbered Go
# project with GoReleaser.
#
# Background:
# - https://goreleaser.com/customization/build/#import-pre-built-binaries
# - https://goreleaser.com/cookbooks/cgo-and-crosscompiling/
#
# Note that this workflow requires GoReleaser Pro (a paid subscription),
# because the workflow relies upon the GoReleaser Pro "pre-built binaries"
# feature, which is not available in the standard GoReleaser distribution.
#
# This workflow will run on any push. That is to say, it runs if you push
# to a branch, or tag a release, etc.
#
# The workflow sequence is:
#
# - "go-test" job is executed, on an OS matrix (macos/darwin, linux, windows).
# - If that succeeds, "build-binaries-X" jobs run for darwin, linux, and windows.
#   - Note that there are separate Linux jobs for "amd64" and "arm64", because
#     they require distinct config. Perhaps it's possible to collapse those distinct
#     Linux configs into one build?
#   - Thus there are five distinct GoRelease config files required:
#     - .goreleaser-darwin.yml
#     - .goreleaser-windows.yml
#     - .goreleaser-linux-amd64.yml
#     - .goreleaser-linux-arm64.yml
#     - .goreleaser.yml: this is the master config that performs publishing.
# - If the "build-binaries-X" jobs all succeed, then the "publish" job runs.
#   It executes the ".goreleaser.yml" config.
#
# The "publish" job runs only if the release is tagged with a value prefixed
# with "v", e.g. "v1.0.1". Note also that the build jobs ("build-binaries-darwin",
# "build-binaries-windows" etc.) set the GoReleaser "--skip-validate" flag
# to "true" or "false", depending upon whether this is a tagged release. This
# state is stored in "env.NO_PUBLISH".
